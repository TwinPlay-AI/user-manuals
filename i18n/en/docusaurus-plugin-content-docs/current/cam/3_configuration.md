# Configuration

## When Needed
:::tip[Note]
- On first use, it is necessary to pair the camera with one (or more) WiFi networks with internet access.
- All saved networks remain in memory, and the camera will automatically connect to the first available network.
:::

The procedure must be repeated if:

1. The network name or password is changed.
2. You want to pair the unit with a new network that it has never accessed before.

## Requirements

- A WiFi network with internet access, whose name and password are known.
- A phone, tablet, or PC different from the one used as a hotspot.

:::danger[Warning]
- Ensure the WiFi network has internet access and does not require additional authentication (besides the password).
- The camera mainly supports **2.4 GHz** WiFi networks. Some 5 GHz channels are not supported. See [**Hotspot Configuration**](#phone-hotspot-configuration) for more information.
- If using a mobile hotspot, a second device is needed for pairing.
:::

### Phone Hotspot Configuration
- **Android Hotspot**: Go to hotspot settings and set the frequency to `2.4 GHz`.
- **iPhone Hotspot**: Go to hotspot settings and enable the `Optimize Compatibility` option.

## Pairing Procedure

1. Turn on the WiFi network you want to connect the camera to.
2. Turn on the processing unit. It is important to turn it on **AFTER** activating the WiFi network.
3. Wait until the light flashes twice before proceeding.
