# Usage Instructions

## Positioning

1. Place the tripod approximately at mid-court, outside the sideline.
2. Extend the tripod, ensuring that the central tube does not touch the ground (only the three tripod feet should be in contact with the surface).
3. Verify that the USB cable is connected both to the camera and the processing unit.
4. Extend the three sections of the tripod to reach the maximum height and direct the camera towards the basket.

## Powering On

1. Connect the power adapter to an electrical outlet. The unit will automatically turn on. If the unit was already plugged in but had been turned off using the button, you can turn it back on using the button.  
2. In about 1 minute, the unit will boot up, and the light button will start blinking regularly.  
If the indicator light shows a different state, check [**Indicator States**](before-starting#indicator-light-states) for more information.

## Training

1. Have all the players who will take part in the session line up in front of the camera (approximately on the three-point line closest to the camera).
2. Train as usual.

## Ending the Session

1. At the end of the training session, hold down the button for 1 second until the light becomes steady. The unit will stop recording, finish uploading the video, and automatically shut down.
2. Once the indicator light has turned off, you can turn off the WiFi network and unplug the power.

:::tip[Note]
For consecutive training sessions with different players, it is recommended to separate sessions by briefly pressing the button.  
In this case, the light will turn off for a few seconds and then start blinking again.  
This ensures the previous session is closed, and a new one starts correctly.
