| No known networks available                                                                                | Turn on a known hotspot/router and restart the unit.<br/>Start the pairing procedure to connect to a new network [HERE](3_configuration.md). |
| The connected network has no internet access                                                               | Verify the network functionality and restart the unit.                                                                                       |
| The modem/hotspot was turned on after the camera and was not detected in time                              | Restart the unit.                                                                                                                            |
| The connected network requires additional authentication                                                   | The camera does not support this type of network. Change the network or disable additional authentication.                                   |
| The hotspot is set to an unsupported frequency (5 GHz) (On iPhones, check "Optimize Compatibility")        | Change the hotspot frequency to 2.4 GHz and restart the unit.                                                                                |
